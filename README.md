# Statistics-for-Data-Science
Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

# Fundamentals of Statistics

* Data science refers to dealing with data. Statistical analysis helps in enhancing predictability, pattern analysis, and concluding and interpreting the data.
* The two fundamental statistics concepts that play a key role in data science are descriptive and inferential statistics.

# Descriptive Statistics  
* This includes the method for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset.
* The different measures of central tendency involved in descriptive statistics include mean, median, and mode.
* Besides, dispersive measures such as range, standard deviation, and variance are also included to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataâ€™s characteristics.


# Inferential Statistics 
* This part of statistics concerns using sample data for inferences or predictions about the population.
* It includes using hypothesis testing to assess the validity of assumptions or claims about the population.
* The concept is also helpful for constructing confidence intervals to estimate the likely range of values for population parameters.
* Inferential statistics are of significance in decision-making.
